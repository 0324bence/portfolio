                        Ever since I created my first website I've had an interest in software development. Creating

                            I am Bence Deli, a software development student in Hungary and I'm looking for my first job.
                            I've been creating websites since elementary school and programming since high school.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've always had a knack for problem-solving, so programming came relatively easily at first.
                            However, I've since learned that there's always more to learn. If you think you know
                            everything, you simply haven't discovered the next challenge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I easily learn new things, especially when they pique my interest. I'm always looking for
                            new technologies and practices to experiment with, and I often adopt them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I make sure to always use a version control system like Git and GitHub for my projects.<br />My

                                Frameworks such as Svelte and Vue have been a great help in my projects. I have
                                experimented with them and have used them in multiple projects.

                                The JavaScript canvas has been a useful tool since I created my first simple paint

                                After Python, our school switched to C#. Since then, I've participated in programming
